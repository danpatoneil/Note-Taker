  ## Installation
  This is simply a website, it is currently hosted on Heroku, users can find it at [this link](https://note-taker-danpatoneil-f451df7663b3.herokuapp.com/notes).

  ## Usage
  This project allows a user to make notes with a title and text with a hidden unique identifier. One can simply open the link and from there can see a list of notes and add to them or delete them from the list. Clicking on an item in the list anywhere but the trash can icon will open it in full view, but clicking the trash can icon will delete them.

  ## How to Contribute
  Users interested in contributing should feel free to make forks of this project, it is a public repo in my github which can be found [here](https://github.com/danpatoneil/Note-Taker). Authentication is the big missing feature, as at this time the website does not use local storage or authentication of any kind and any user can simply go to the link and see the list of notes there and edit them as they wish. Another missing feature might be the ability to reorder the list of tasks, perhaps doable through jqueryUI. Another issue is that notes can be deleted too easily, there is no last chance prompt asking users to confirm that they did mean to delete the note.
